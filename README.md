## Road Lane Detection Tool

This project provides a straightforward solution for detecting road lanes from a camera stream. By adjusting parameters such as lane width and line thickness, users can enhance lane visibility and minimize visual interference from other elements in the scene.

By changing the following you can adjust the line thickness and lane width of the filter.
```
int min_pixel_count_line = 7;
int max_pixel_count_line = 25;

int min_pixel_count_track_width = 400;
int max_pixel_count_track_width = 500;
```
